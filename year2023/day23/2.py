"""
Big idea: treat this as a weighted undirected graph.  Enumerate (NetworkX's all simple graphs
is used here but anything should work) the paths from start to end and take the one with the
greatest path weight.

Before doing that, simplify the graph.  It has a lot of "hallways" that can be removed, for example
in the sample input it isn't until the path is at row 4, column 12 that there's a choice of direction.  
The path from the start to that spot can be treated as one edge with a weight of the steps skipped
between them.

For example, in this graph

    a -1- b -1- c -1- d ...
    |     |           |
    1     1           1
    |     |           |
    e -1- f -1- g -1- h
    .
    .
    .
    
c can be snipped, which results in

    a -1- b ----2---- d ...
    |     |           |
    1     1           1
    |     |           |
    e -1- f -1- g -1- h
    .
    .
    .

This simplifies the graph from (in my input file) 9424 vertices to 36, so the na√Øve enumeration of all paths works.
